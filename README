Welcome to the resting state EEG dataset collected at the University of San Diego and curated by Alex Rockhill at the University of Oregon.

Please email arockhil@uoregon.edu before submitting a manuscript to be published in a peer-reviewed journal using this data, we wish to ensure that the data to be analyzed and interpretted with scientific integrity so as not to mislead the public about findings that may have clinical relevance.

Note that UPDRS rating scales were collected by laboratory personell who had completed online training and not a board-certified neurologist. Results should be interpretted accordingly, especially that analyses based largely on these ratings should be taken with the appropriate amount of uncertainty.
